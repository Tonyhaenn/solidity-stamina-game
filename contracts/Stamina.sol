Trying to avoid need to loop over every players balance
1) Keep track of total player value + all player values every time stake?
2) Since we know the end date of the contract, 24H prior to end, start flagging players that play in that window, and therefore will get their entire stake back plus share of broken?
3) hmm. still need a separate TX with loop to identify broken players?
